# ðŸš¨ GitHub Pages Error Fix

## The Error You're Seeing:
```
Error: Get Pages site failed. Please verify that the repository has Pages enabled and configured to build using GitHub Actions
```

## âœ… Quick Fix (2 minutes):

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/Amakran2003/sunoneorganic/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Re-run the Workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/Amakran2003/sunoneorganic/actions
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Click "Re-run all jobs"

### Step 3: Success! 
Your site will be live at: https://amakran2003.github.io/sunoneorganic/

## Why This Happened:
- The workflow tried to deploy before GitHub Pages was enabled
- GitHub Pages must be manually enabled in repository settings first
- After enabling, workflows can deploy automatically

## That's It! 
Once you enable Pages and re-run the workflow, everything will work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
