# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## ✅ What I've Done

I've successfully set up your project for GitHub Pages deployment by:

1. ✅ **Created GitHub Actions Workflow**: Added `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. ✅ **Committed and Pushed**: The workflow is now in your GitHub repository
3. ✅ **Ready for Deployment**: Your site will automatically deploy on every push

## 🎯 Next Steps (Manual Configuration Required)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/Amakran2003/sunoneorganic
2. **Click on "Settings"** (top menu bar of your repo)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")
4. **Configure the Source**:
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - This will enable the workflow we just created

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

1. **Check Actions Tab**: Go to https://github.com/Amakran2003/sunoneorganic/actions
2. **Look for "Deploy static content to Pages"** workflow
3. **Wait for green checkmark** (usually takes 1-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Access Your Live Website

Once deployment completes, your website will be available at:
**https://amakran2003.github.io/sunoneorganic/**

## 🔧 What the Workflow Does

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- ✅ Triggers on every push to the `main` branch
- ✅ Deploys your entire repository as a static website
- ✅ Makes your `index.html` the homepage
- ✅ Serves all your images and assets correctly
- ✅ Updates the live site instantly on any changes

## 🎨 Your Website Features

Your deployed site will showcase:
- 🌿 **360° Panorama**: Interactive vegetable yield viewer
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- 🖼️ **Image Gallery**: Your processed vegetable images
- ✨ **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradients and animations

## 🔄 Future Updates

To update your website:
1. Make changes to your files locally
2. Run: `git add .`
3. Run: `git commit -m "Your update message"`
4. Run: `git push origin main`
5. Website updates automatically in 1-3 minutes!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If the workflow fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)
3. Verify the workflow file syntax is correct

### If images don't load:
1. Check that image paths in `index.html` are relative (not absolute)
2. Ensure images are committed to the repository
3. Verify image files exist in the `images/` folder
